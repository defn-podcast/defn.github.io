## Summary

10th episode â€¦ holy shit we hit double figures!

We celebrate with another village idiot special, this time discussing spec

Thanks again to Lucas and Michael for a great episode last time. There is lots of love out there for the project so keep it up!

## Interlude
- A short, possibly disastrous interlude from **defray:** impure amusement
    - A podcast first for the Clojure Comedian

## Main discussion - Spec
- What it is - what is the history: Type checking, contracts and Prismatic schema
- Why in 1.9, not just a lib?
- What can we do with it?
    - Optional type specification for data and functions
    - Compile time checking
    - Validity / Conformance: Results / Errors as a map
    - Generative testing - test.check
    - Runtime checking
    - Namespaces on keywords: the revenge of XML continues :)
    - Effect on the language
        - What happens to macros?
        - Better error messages?
    - Effect on the eco-system: better tooling? versioning?
