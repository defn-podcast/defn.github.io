## Summary

Where we learn all about the expressive power of Clojure running at the speed of raw machine code on CPUs and GPUs.

Also, a few words of advice from Dragan for intrepid Clojurians:

> Unfortunately, I cannot recommend any Java-specific or even Python specific book for ML, since all that I have seen concentrate on the easy part (how to call specific functions) but are superficial on the hard part (understanding particular ML techniques).
>
> The most important advice: there is no way around the math… moderate understanding of at least calculus and linear algebra is a must.
