## Summary

- Before Clojure ... journey to ( enlightenment )

- JUXT ... what it is and how it's going

- Yada

- Motivation
    - Did we need yet another HTTP server? Why Aleph over ring?
    - Benefits of HTTP? And why is HATEOAS proving so elusive?
- On the details of Yada
    - Resource model - defaults, extensibility by data and functions
    - Routing - based on resources, relationship with bidi (plus explanation of bidi)
    - SSE - real-time notification system over HTTP, hiding in plain sight
    - Swagger - the good and the bad
    - Security - resource centred concepts, form-based, integrations with standard schemes
    - Advanced topics - interceptors
    - Future thoughts on Yada 2.0 (if that's allowed these days!)

Community questions (new feature):

From @RobStuttaford on Twitter:
> Curious how Juxt hires Clj devs. Do you train them up? Hire seasoned pros? If you train, what's that look like?

From @shaun-mahood on Slack:
> Has he looked at spec much, and if so does he have any thoughts on how things would change in yada if yada were to replace schema with spec?

From @anmonteiro on Slack:
> Not exactly a question but I'd love if the show touched a little on Malcolm's talk at ClojuTRE, i.e. what they're doing at JUXT for their website
